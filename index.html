                        Dear Alydoo,<br>


                        Happy valentines day sha, I'm so happy and lucky to have you as my valentine, couldn't have asked for anyone better than you babe. 
                        I've never done this before and usually found writting love letters to be a bit cringe, and I'm not even sure if I'll be able to convey everything I want to say, but I feel that this is really important
                        for me to do (especially given the fact that you're all the way in GZ). We both know that I'm not the best at expressing my feelings/emotions but I really want to convey how I really feel about you as
                        you are the most special person in my life, so please bear with me as I try to do so. 

                        <br><br>
                        
                        
                        You've always asked my why I choose to be with you and I could never really answer it fully as there is just too many reasons. You are just
                        near perfect in my eyes, YOU are my dream girl. For starters, you are one of the the prettiest thing I've ever set my eyes on. From the first time I saw you
                        during orientation, I couldn't help but admire your eyes and I honestly don't know why, but it never fails to give butterflies on my stomach.
                        Everything else about your sharp nose, long lashes, voice, lips, hair, body and even your slightly bigger than average not so big forehead is just what I like. 
                        I love how your cheeks bunched up when you smile and get all excited about something. I love the way you get shy when something embarasses you, and I love seeing
                        the other more softer side of you that not that many people get to see. You are also one of the best person I know, you have a kind heart and I really admire how strong and brave you are
                        to overcome all the shit that you've been through. Not that many people have been through what you experienced, and even less were able to overcome it as well as you did. Not only 
                        are you extremely intelligent, you are also social, confident, and independent. You prioritize your education and
                        have things going on for you, which is something that I admire a lot. Despite this, you're still very fun and outgoing, and there is rarely a dull moment with you.
                        We have the same taste and views on so many things, and though you can be annoying sometimes, you are always the person I'm looking forward to meet
                        ever single day. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        
                        When I'm with you Sha, I'm the happiest man in the world - you never fail to brighten up my day and be there to comfort me
                        when I'm feeling down. I'm the most of myself when I'm with you as you never make me feel like I need to be someone that I'm not. 
                        These may not be that big of a deal but I really appreciate the times you comforted me when I had to deal with uni stuff, or even had to deal with om Oky's bullshit. 
                        You are also very thoughtful and the little things you do such as cooking for me, washing my clothes, stocking up on milk even though youre lactose intolerant,
                        buying soap or an airpod casing for me never fails to make me happy. You just make me feel so loved.
                        
                        I'm also extremely thankful to you Sha, you have undoubtedly made me a better person. Looking at your work ethic and how determined you are to do good in Uni and for your future has really
                        inspired me and made me want to do the same. Even though I am still tardy as a person, you have also made me strive to be more on time. You have also taught me how to love,
                        to be honest with you I am very bad with showing love, even to my own mom. But I noticed that since being with you, I constantly try to find ways to express my love and you have taught me 
                        the many ways in which I can do so. And I admit this is one of my biggest flaws and I still need make major improvements on this, 
                        but I hope you know that I'm trying to do better, so don't hesitate to tell me if im doing something wrong and how I can do better. I really do love you, and I'm so sorry if I haven't really been able to properly show much of my love to you.
                        Thank you for allowing me to be myself, to be awkward, to be vulnerable. Thank you for being my first valentine and I really do hope you'd be my last. I'm just so grateful to know you
                        and have you in my life.
                        
                        
                        <br><br>
                        We have made so many memories together and you have made the past 6 months one of the best time of my life. I hope we get to continue to visit places and go food hunting together.
                        Have tickle fights and laugh at the dumbest jokes. Watch movies and play silly games. Tell each other stories and go on banters together. I hope I'd get to continue to be the one you call on 
                        a bad day,  the one to always be there for you and spend my days with you.  I hope I'll be able to bring all the love and happiness in the world for you, and chase away all of your 
                        problems. And though it has not and will not always be sunshine and rainbows, I hope we get to continue to argue and work out whatever
                        problems we face together. Whatever it is, I hope to get to always do it all with you. The world just feels better with you by my side. I'll be working hard everyday to be the guy worthy of your
                        love. Looking forward to many more adventures and moments with you sha. I love you. <br> <br>
